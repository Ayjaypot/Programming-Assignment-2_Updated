# Programming-Assignment-2_Updated
Programming Assignment for the funtions of the Numerical Python Library specifically arrays. The assignment aims to utilize and use the numerical python library or numpy the assignment has two problems that will test and deepen the understanding of the numpy library
specifically arrays. For the first problem a random array assigned as X should be normalized using a given formula.

in the code the array is put into X and then the value of the mean and STD of the array were gotten through a built in function and were then used with the formula to produce the normalized array.

The output of the first problem should be saved as a .npy file

For the 2nd problem an 10x10 array containing the squares of the first 100 positive integers should be created, and then after that a function to select and print the digits that are divisible by 3 from the array should be created as well.

in this code an array of the first 100 positive integers were created first before using a function to get the squares of those 100 numbers, it is then shaped into the desired 10x10 array. Next a code using the modulo function were used to find the numbers that are divisible by 3 after that the array of those numbers are then saved into a .npy file
